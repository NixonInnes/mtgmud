* Refactor all references from client.user to user
     - Think this is mostly done now; will leave this here until i'm 100%

* Add a user.id (same used in user.db.id)
    - Nah, I think I'll stick with user.db.id... i think

* Add user aliases, because typing out commands in full is for suckers

* Add a mud.models.USER_FLAGS global list

* Add user.flags

* Add function to watch other connected users
    - Add check in user.msg_user to see if there are users in their user.spectator list, and send to that user too

* Add user flag, ALLOW_SPECTATORS

* Add user list of allowed spectators (user.id) { if user.id in u.spectators }
    - Will need to be saved to the db
